# Quick Start

Learn how to build a microservices event bus architecture using CAP, which offers advantages over direct integration of message queues, and what out-of-the-box features it provides.

## Installation

```powershell
PM> Install-Package DotNetCore.CAP
```

##  Integrated in Asp.Net Core

For quick start, we use memory-based event storage and message transport.

```powershell
PM> Install-Package DotNetCore.CAP.InMemoryStorage
PM> Install-Package Savorboard.CAP.InMemoryMessageQueue
```

In `Startup.cs` ï¼Œadd the following configuration:

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCap(x =>
    {
        x.UseInMemoryStorage();
        x.UseInMemoryMessageQueue();
    });
}
```

## Publish Message

```c#
public class PublishController : Controller
{
    [Route("~/send")]
    public IActionResult SendMessage([FromServices]ICapPublisher capBus)
    {
        capBus.Publish("test.show.time", DateTime.Now);

        return Ok();
    }
}
```

## Process Message

```C#
public class ConsumerController : Controller
{
    [NonAction]
    [CapSubscribe("test.show.time")]
    public void ReceiveMessage(DateTime time)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("message time is:" + time);
    }
}
```

## Summary

One of the most powerful advantages of asynchronous messaging over direct integrated message queues is reliability, where failures in one part of the system do not propagate or cause the entire system to crash. Messages are stored inside the CAP to ensure the reliability of the message, and strategies such as retry are used to achieve the final consistency of data between services.
