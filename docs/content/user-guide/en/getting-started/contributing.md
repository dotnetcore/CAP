# Contributing

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and address issues. 

If you have any questions or problems, please report them on the CAP repository:

<a href="https://github.com/dotnetcore/cap/issues/new"><button data-md-color-primary="purple"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> Report Issue</button></a>
<a href="https://github.com/dotnetcore/cap/issues"><button data-md-color-primary="purple" type="submit"> Active Issues <i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i></button></a>

## Submitting Changes

You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
