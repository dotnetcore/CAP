# Transports

Transports move data from one place to another – between acquisition programs and pipelines, between pipelines and the entity database, and even between pipelines and external systems.

## Supported transports

CAP supports several transport methods:

* [RabbitMQ](rabbitmq.md)
* [Kafka](kafka.md)
* [Azure Service Bus](azure-service-bus.md)
* [Amazon SQS](aws-sqs.md)
* [In-Memory Queue](in-memory-queue.md)
